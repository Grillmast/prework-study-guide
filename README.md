Prework Study Guide for Bootcamp

## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through their prework modules. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. We built the guide starting in HTML to create a solid foundation. We then moved to CSS to create a unique look for our page. We then brought functionality to our project with JavaScript. Throughout the whole process we involved git and learned the correct workflow with github.
